# Rethinking Chemistry
 
The Center for the Transformation of Chemistry (CTC) is Germany’s first research center dedicated to circular chemistry. Its mission is to drive the transformation of the chemical industry toward a more sustainable future. Established in 2025, the CTC is projected to grow up to 1,000 employees by 2038.
 
The team will collaborate on two visionary moonshots for chemistry: the autonomous laboratory and the completely recyclable car. With facilities in Delitzsch (Saxony) and Merseburg (Saxony-Anhalt), the CTC will contribute to the structural transformation of Central Germany. The shareholders of the CTC are the Federal Republic of Germany, the Free State of Saxony, and the State of Saxony-Anhalt.
